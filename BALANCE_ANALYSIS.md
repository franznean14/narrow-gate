# Game Balance Analysis

## Current Card Distribution

### SUPPLY_POOL (44 unique cards)
- **Positive Cards:**
  - FaithAction: 15 cards (2 base points + 5 bonus = 7 potential points each)
  - Prayer: 15 cards (3 points + wildcard effects)
  - Quality: 2 cards (permanent buffs)
  - **Total Positive: 32 cards**

- **Negative Cards:**
  - Trial: 7 cards (burdens, -1 to -2 points, movement restrictions)
  - Obligation: 5 cards (teleport, end turn)
  - **Total Negative: 12 cards**

- **Characters:** 12 cards (positive abilities)

### Current Multiplication
- SUPPLY_POOL × 4 = 176 cards
- + Characters (12) = 188 total
- After starter hands (12 removed) = 176 remaining

### Ratio Analysis
- Positive:Negative = 32:12 = 2.67:1 (excluding characters)
- With characters: 44:12 = 3.67:1

## Gameplay Simulation

### Turn Flow (4 players, ~10 rounds to complete)
- Each player: 3 AP per turn
- Actions: Move (1 AP), Draw (1 AP), Play Card (varies), Help (1 AP)
- Average cards drawn per player per round: ~2-3
- Total cards drawn per round: ~8-12 cards

### Challenge Requirements
- Average Challenge req: ~15-18 points
- With 1.8x multiplier: ~27-32 points needed
- Per round: ~6-8 cards needed to overcome challenge

### Balance Issues Identified

1. **Too Many Positive Cards**
   - 176 positive cards vs 48 negative cards (after ×4)
   - Players will rarely struggle with card draw
   - Challenges might be too easy to overcome

2. **Trial Cards Too Rare**
   - Only 7 unique × 4 = 28 Trial cards
   - With 176 total cards, ~16% chance to draw Trial
   - May not create enough pressure

3. **Obligation Cards**
   - Only 5 unique × 4 = 20 Obligation cards
   - ~11% chance to draw
   - May not create enough disruption

4. **Circumstance Multiplier**
   - Circumstances multiply faith requirements (1.0x to 2.0x)
   - But with so many positive cards, this may not matter enough

## Recommendations for Physical Print

Since cards will be printed, we need a fixed deck. Here's a balanced structure:

### Proposed Balanced Deck Structure

**SUPPLY_POOL (Base Set - 60 cards):**
- FaithAction: 15 cards (keep)
- Prayer: 15 cards (keep)
- Quality: 3 cards (add 1 more)
- Trial: 12 cards (add 5 more negative trials)
- Obligation: 8 cards (add 3 more obligations)
- **Characters: 12 cards** (include in base set)

**Multiplied for 4-player game:**
- Base × 3 = 180 cards (not 4, to reduce deck size)
- This gives: 45 FaithAction, 45 Prayer, 9 Quality, 36 Trial, 24 Obligation, 12 Characters
- **Total: 171 cards** (more manageable for printing)

**Alternative: Single Copy Deck (Recommended)**
- Use all 60 unique cards once
- Smaller deck = more strategic, less random
- Players must manage resources carefully
- **Total: 60 cards** (much easier to print)

## Balance Adjustments Needed

1. **Add More Negative Trials** (5 more):
   - Fear, Discouragement, Pride, Selfishness, Worldly Distraction

2. **Add More Obligations** (3 more):
   - Family Emergency, Work Deadline, Social Obligation

3. **Add 1 More Quality Card**:
   - Patience, Humility, or another positive trait

4. **Adjust Challenge Requirements**:
   - If using single copy deck, reduce requirements by ~30%
   - If using ×3 deck, keep current requirements
