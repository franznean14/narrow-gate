Build the cards based on this:



Love this brief. I’ll design this as a publishable, table-ready card + light board game, with depth and replayability comparable to Exploding Kittens, Doomlings, and Happy Little Dinosaurs—but cooperative, faith-affirming, and Bible-anchored.



⸻



Game Title



⚖️ Covenant & Kingdom



“Choose this day whom you will serve.” — Joshua 24:15



A semi-cooperative Bible strategy card game about faith, choices, and the great issue between Jehovah’s sovereignty and Satan’s challenge.



⸻



Core Pillars (Design DNA)



✔ Bible-based, Scripture-accurate

✔ Uplifting & cooperative (no “attack” mechanics)

✔ Engaging chaos + meaningful decisions

✔ Teaches Bible characters, themes, and verses

✔ Group-play friendly (3–6 players)

✔ Short setup, fast turns, high replay value



⸻



Theme & Narrative



Players are Servants of the Covenant, living during different Bible eras.

The universe is watching the great issue:



Can humans serve Jehovah out of love, even under pressure?



Satan seeks to prove loyalty fails.

Jehovah invites faith, patience, and love.



Players must collect Faith, Love, Obedience, and Endurance while guiding humanity toward Jehovah’s side of the board—together.



You win or lose as a group, but individual choices matter.



⸻



Components



🃏 Cards (120–150 total)



1. Character Cards (40)

Bible figures with special abilities.



Examples:

• Moses – “If you sacrifice a turn, prevent all trials this round.”

• Ruth – “When you help another player, gain 1 Love.”

• David – “When facing trials, draw one extra card.”

• Esther – “Once per game, reverse a negative event.”

• Job – “Trials affect you less but last longer.”



Each card includes:

• Ability

• Theme verse

• Faith Attribute



⸻



2. Verse Cards (30)

Real Bible verses with game effects.



Examples:

• “Perfect love casts out fear.” (1 John 4:18)

→ Remove Fear tokens from all players.

• “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.” (Heb 13:6)

→ Ignore the next Satan Event.

• “The fruitage of the spirit is love…” (Gal 5:22)

→ Gain 1 of each Faith Attribute (shared).



Players read verses aloud—this is intentional.



⸻



3. Choice Cards (25)

Moral or faith-based decisions.



Example:



A crowd pressures you to compromise.

A) Stand firm (gain Faith, risk Trial)

B) Stay silent (no gain, no loss)



No option is “evil”—but some strengthen faith more than others.



⸻



4. Trial Cards (20)

Challenges, doubts, delays, persecution.



Examples:

• Delay

• Discouragement

• Fear

• Peer Pressure

• Materialism



Trials test, they don’t “attack.”



⸻



5. Blessing Cards (15)

Rewards for endurance.



Examples:

• Peace

• Wisdom

• Unity

• Courage



⸻



🧩 Tokens

• Faith

• Love

• Endurance

• Obedience

• Unity (shared group resource)



⸻



🧭 The Board (Central Innovation)



A simple track board divided into two halves:



🟦 Jehovah’s Side (Light)



Represents:

• Trust

• Love

• Truth

• Loyalty



🟥 Satan’s Side (Dark)



Represents:

• Doubt

• Fear

• Pride

• Self-interest



🪐 Universe Marker starts in the center.



🔄 How it Moves

• Faithful choices, verses, cooperation → move toward Jehovah

• Division, fear, unresolved trials → drift toward Satan



⚠️ No player controls Satan directly.

He influences through events and trials, not player cruelty.



⸻



🎯 Objective



Group Win:



✔ Reach the final space on Jehovah’s side

✔ AND at least one player embodies each Faith Attribute



Group Loss:



❌ Board reaches Satan’s final space

❌ OR Unity token reaches zero



⸻



🔁 Turn Structure (Fast & Fun)

1. Draw 1 Card

2. Play 1 Card OR Assist another player

3. Resolve Board Effects

4. Optional Prayer Phase

• Discard a Verse to help anyone



Turns are quick (30–45 seconds).



⸻



🤝 Cooperation Mechanics (Key Differentiator)

• You can give cards freely

• Helping others often gives you rewards

• Some cards only activate when used together

• Unity is stronger than individual success



This reinforces:



“We are many members, but one body.” (Rom 12:5)



⸻



📚 Teaching Without Preaching

• Every card teaches one truth

• Verses are contextual, not random

• Character abilities reflect Bible narratives

• Choices mirror real faith challenges



Players learn by playing, not memorizing.



⸻



🎉 Replayability

• Random Character combinations

• Variable Trials

• Modular board sides (Old Covenant / Christian Era)

• Optional advanced rules:

• Time pressure

• Secret personal faith goals

• Cooperative “campaign” mode



⸻



🧠 Target Audience

• Families (10+)

• Youth groups

• Bible study groups

• Church game nights

• Mixed-belief households (non-judgmental tone)



⸻



🛠️ Expansion Ideas

• “Faithful Women” Pack

• “Prophets & Kings”

• “Christian Congregation Era”

• Solo Devotional Mode

• Legacy Campaign (journaling + cards)



⸻



✨ Why This Works

• Keeps the fun chaos of modern card games

• Removes cruelty without removing tension

• Makes Bible truth interactive

• Centers on love, loyalty, and cooperation

• Reflects the Jehovah vs Satan issue accurately

• Encourages conversation after the game ends



⸻



If you want, next I can:

• Prototype 10 real cards (fully written)

• Design a print-and-play version

• Simplify for kids or deepen for adults

• Tune theology toward a specific Christian audience



Just tell me where you want to go next 🙌

I have designed a comprehensive digital card set for Covenant & Kingdom. This interactive gallery includes the foundational cards across all five categories (Characters, Verses, Choices, Trials, and Blessings), styled with a modern, high-contrast aesthetic suitable for a premium tabletop experience.
Covenant & Kingdom
26 Dec, 06:30

Key Design Features
Distinctive Visual Branding:

Character Cards: Feature bold header colors and a "Faith Attribute" tag to help players track group-win conditions.

Verse Cards: Use a dark, elegant slate theme to denote "Holy Ground" or foundational truth, focusing on the scripture text.

Choice Cards: Highlighted in orange to signify a "Warning" or "Moment of Decision," with clearly labeled options.

Trial Cards: Minimalist and dark (Black/Red), representing darkness or pressure, with clear mechanical penalties.

Educational Integration: Every card includes a real Bible reference and verse. Character abilities are direct narrative reflections (e.g., Moses sacrificing a turn to protect others, mirroring his role as a mediator).

Modern Tabletop UX: The layout is inspired by modern hits like Wingspan and Marvel Champions, ensuring information is hierarchical: Title -> Ability -> Flavor Text -> Reference.

Suggested Next Steps
Print-and-Play: I can generate a specialized layout for printing these cards (e.g., 9-up on an A4 sheet).

Expansion Packs: We could develop the "Prophets & Kings" expansion which introduces "Anointing" mechanics.

Board Design: I can create a digital mockup of the "Covenant Track" board that players move their markers along.

Please create the complete cards on the code above. Also put the mockup board.

I have expanded the card set significantly and integrated a Real-Time Board Mockup that visualizes "The Great Issue" track. This update includes a robust collection of cards across all five categories and a functional dashboard to track Unity, Faith Attributes, and the position of the Universe Marker.
Covenant & Kingdom
29 Dec, 14:33

Improvements and Features
Functional Board Simulator: I added a "Great Issue" track (-5 to +5). You can use the "Live Simulator" controls to move the Universe Marker, adjust group Unity, and toggle the Faith Attributes. This demonstrates how the game's objective logic works.

Expanded Card Set:

Characters: Added Noah (Protection), Abraham (Movement), Paul (Zeal), Lydia (Generosity), and Daniel (Integrity). Each has a unique mechanical niche.

Verses: Added Armor of God and Be Courageous to show how scripture acts as a "buffer" against negative events.

Choices: Added Hidden Treasure, creating a tension between personal power (Verses) and the collective group goal (Board movement).

Visual Depth:

The board uses a modern "dark mode" aesthetic with neon glows for the light/dark poles.

The card gallery features a responsive grid with hover animations.

Responsive design ensures it works on both mobile and desktop (essential for playtesting sessions).

How to use the Prototype
Toggle between Views: Use the navigation bar at the top to switch between the Board (strategy/state overview) and the Card Gallery (browsing the deck).

Simulate a Game State: On the Board view, try to toggle all 5 attributes and move the marker to "5" while keeping Unity above 0. This simulates a "Group Win."

Review Cards: Filter by category in the Gallery to see how different card types interact. For example, check Trial cards to see the "Materialism" challenge.

can you code a prototype gameplay with complete cards and dynamic number of players where I can preview on an ipad flat on the table and players can surround the ipad (depending how many), and be able to click open a pile or drag to play card on their hand, etc. this is to test the POC with friends

I have designed a fully interactive Tabletop "Pass-and-Play" Prototype specifically for an iPad lying flat on a table.

Key Features for Tablet Play
360° Layout: Supports 2-4 players with UI zones rotated to face each seat around the device.

Touch-Optimized Interaction: Large touch targets. Tap a card to "inspect/select" it, then tap the board to play it. This is more reliable than dragging on a shared browser screen.

Dynamic Deck: Generates a playable deck from the data we created, handles shuffling, dealing, and discard piles.

The "Great Issue" Track: A central, interactive board that tracks the group's progress.

How to Test This
Device: Open this preview on an iPad or Tablet.

Orientation: Place the device flat on the table in the center of the group.

Seating:

2 Players: Sit opposite each other (Top/Bottom).

3 Players: Sit in a T-shape (Bottom, Left, Right).

4 Players: One on each side (Bottom, Left, Top, Right).

Gameplay: The active player's name highlights in Amber.

Hello! I can definitely help you add some Gemini-powered magic to your Covenant & Kingdom prototype.

I'll introduce two new features:

✨ "Seek Guidance" (AI Card Generator): Instead of drawing from the deck, players can ask the AI to generate a unique, context-aware card based on the current game state (e.g., if Unity is low, it might generate a card about "reconciliation").

📜 "Prophetic Insight" (AI Narrator): A feature that analyzes the board's "spiritual atmosphere" and generates a dramatic, flavor-filled description of the current battle between Light and Darkness.

Here is the updated code:

Just answer this. I'm thinking of changing the gameplay style. I want the gameplay to be like this:



after distribution of cards there will be different piles of cards:



each round starts with an event (challenge/disaster/endurance/etc). this will come from a pile called "challenge" pile drawn face up - an event or something that requires an action (an action card?) or specific quality (quality/character card?)



Then there's the circumstance pile - a card will be drawn from here and turn face up - this will either give an advantage or disadvantage to all players or players with specific cards (idk what type of cards yet)



prayer pile - just some sort of supply cards



faith in action pile - a player can draw from this pile and each card will give some sort of advantage but only if the player will be able to answer the question (depending on the type of card will be a type of question, so maybe christian-greek/hebrew-aramaic/doctrinal/Jehovah's qualities type?) (so there should be a list of questions with different difficulties, which difficulties will depend on a dice roll, lower easier, higher more difficult) - if answered correctly (enough), player can take the card drawn that will give a certain advantage - otherwise lose the card forever (except if a player plays a certain cards that replenishes this pile at anytime) - player can ask help from others if he/she is 2-3 nodes away, also the player can play a card that will move his character to 2-3 nodes away if necessary.



character cards - these cards can be placed on the table in front of each player - gives permanent advantage/disadvantage each turn unless removed by other cards of some sort (if another player removes a disadvantage, unity points increase)



now that I think about it prayer/faith in action/character cards should be from 1 pile.



Personal trial cards - will require the player to supply (discard) some cards (other players 2-3 nodes away can help). or all players can discard a prayer card).



to end the round the challenge with its set circumstance should be overcome (supply the required type of cards, must be challenging enough to make turns go at least 2 cycle). if round is endurance type, prayer cards will play a big role because other card effects will be reduced to half. each round should give the players the dilemma whether to just finish the round with/without increasing unity points.



Special rounds (should be climactic with all players on their toes):

(Great Tribulation) - this will intensify negative effects

(Armageddon) - final round

I want to brainstorm about this more soon.



Other mechanics:

add the closeness factor - the mat (board) should have like lines and nodes where each player (character pin or something?) is on a node directly in front of them (max 4-6 players?). players on each turn can play a card to supply the round challenge required cards or play a card that will allow him to move the nodes closer to other players). the node map should be not too simple, complex enough that will make going to other players challenging).



players who are 2-3 nodes from other players can help each other (this will impress the idea that is' important to be close to the friends, rather than isolate). each round that is overcome, depending on how many players are 2-3 nodes to each others will add unity points.



Now I actually don't know the best way for how each turn takes place. do the players draw a card and that card effect will take effect immediately or can the players keep it for now (or maybe if it's a positive card the player can keep it, if it's negative it immediately takes effect?)



The overall goal of the game is for everyone to:

1. see importance of unity

2. see importance of being close with the friends, not isolate

3. other good lessons from the cards

4. importance of good qualities

5. importance of helping others

6. importance of prayers

7. improve knowledge from the bible

8. more good stuff later.



what do you think about this. I'm open for improvements and suggestions.

This is a significant and exciting pivot! You are moving from a Linear Race Game (like Candy Land or The Game of Life) to a Tactical Cooperative Survival Game (like Pandemic, Forbidden Island, or Spirit Island).

This new direction aligns much better with your goal of teaching interdependency and unity. In a race game, players inherently want to move forward. In a node-based survival game, players must move toward each other to survive.

Here is a breakdown of how this new mechanic can work, suggestions for the turn structure, and how to handle the "Closeness Factor."

1. The Core Loop: "Stand Firm & Gather Together"
This structure balances the randomness of trials with the strategy of unity.

The Decks (Revised)
To keep the table clean, we consolidate into two main draw sources:

The Adversary Deck (Red/Black Back): Contains Challenges (the main threat), Circumstances (modifiers), and Special Events (Great Tribulation).

The Supply Deck (Blue/Gold Back): Contains Prayer (wildcards), Qualities/Character (permanent buffs), Faith in Action (trivia/actions), and Personal Trials (immediate negative attachments).

2. The Mechanics Breakdown
The "Closeness" Map (The Board)
Instead of a straight line, imagine a Network Graph (like a spiderweb or a constellation).

Nodes: There are ~10-12 nodes representing spiritual locations or abstract states (e.g., "The Congregation," "The Ministry," "Secular Work," "Home," "Trial").

Connections: Lines connect these nodes. Some are close (1 step), some far (3 steps).

Isolating Factors: Some Adversary cards might break a connection line, forcing players to take the long way around to help a friend.

The "Faith in Action" (Trivia Mechanic)
The Risk: Trivia in games can sometimes make people feel bad if they don't know the answer, or it stalls the game.

The Solution: Make the Trivia a Bonus Multiplier.

Example: You play a "Preaching" card to help the group. It contributes 1 Point to the goal automatically.

The Action: You can choose to "Answer a Question."

Roll Dice: (1-3 = Easy, 4-6 = Hard).

Result: If you answer correctly, the card counts for 3 Points instead of 1. If you fail, it stays at 1 point.

Why this works: It rewards knowledge without punishing those who are learning.

Immediate vs. Held Cards
To answer your question:

Positive Cards (Prayer, Qualities, Action): Go into the player's Hand. This allows for strategy ("I'll save this strong card for the Great Tribulation").

Negative Cards (Personal Trials): If drawn from the Supply pile, they are Played Immediately in front of the player.

Effect: "Burden." While this card is in front of you, you cannot move or you draw 1 less card.

Resolution: Another player within 2 nodes must discard a card to remove it from you. (Enforces closeness).

3. Proposed Turn Structure
Here is a 4-step flow that creates the "2 cycle" pacing you mentioned.

Phase 1: The Scene is Set (Start of Round)

Reveal Challenge: Draw top card of Adversary Deck (e.g., "Economic Hardship"). It requires 10 Supply Points to overcome.

Reveal Circumstance: Draw next card (e.g., "Bad Weather" - Movement costs double this round).

Phase 2: Player Actions (The Turn) Each player takes a turn (going clockwise). On their turn, they have 3 Action Points (AP) to spend:

Move (1 AP): Move pin 1 node.

Encourage (1 AP): Give a card from hand to a player on the same or adjacent node.

Use Supply (1 AP):

Play a Quality: Place on table (Permanent Buff).

Contribute to Challenge: Discard a card to add points to the round goal.

Faith in Action: Play card + Roll Dice + Answer Question for massive points.

Draw (End of Turn): Draw back up to hand limit (e.g., 5 cards). If a Personal Trial is drawn, reveal immediately.

Phase 3: The Adversary Strikes (End of Round) If the Challenge is not overcome by the end of the round:

Consequence: The Challenge triggers a negative effect (e.g., "Lose 1 Unity" or "Everyone discards 1 card").

Progress: The Challenge stays active for the next round (accumulating difficulty).

Phase 4: Unity Check

If the Challenge was overcome: Count how many players are within 2 nodes of each other.

Reward: Gain Unity Points based on that number.

4. Special Rounds (The Climax)
You mentioned Great Tribulation and Armageddon. These shouldn't just be "harder," they should change the rules.

Great Tribulation (Mid-Game Boss):

Trigger: Shuffled into the bottom half of the Adversary Deck.

Effect: "Scattered Sheep." All players are instantly moved to the furthest nodes on the map (maximum isolation). Communication (table talk) is banned until players move back within 2 nodes of each other.

Armageddon (Final Boss):

Objective: Survival. The goal is no longer to "solve" the challenge, but to Hold Fast.

Mechanic: Players must endure 3 rounds of intense attacks without Unity dropping to zero. Prayer cards drawn during this phase count double.

5. Summary of Improvements
Mechanic	Old Way (Race)	New Way (Tactical Network)
Movement	Move toward finish line.	Move toward friends to form a defensive cluster.
Helping	Give cards if able.	Must be physically close (2-3 nodes) on board to help.
Questions	(Not present)	Faith in Action: Optional risk/reward to supercharge cards.
Winning	Reach the end first/group.	Survive the deck + Keep Unity high.
What do you think?
This feels much more "theocratic" in its simulation—it emphasizes that spiritual survival depends on physical and emotional closeness to the congregation, especially when "events" (persecution/disaster) strike.

If you like this, I can update the code to:

Replace the linear track with a Node Map (Canvas).

Implement the "Distance Check" logic (calculating if players are close enough to help).

Add the Trivia Modal flow.

yes please. update code with these 3 things. I like the armageddon objective and mechanic you added and also everything else you mentioned.

I've completely overhauled the prototype to implement the Tactical Cooperative Survival gameplay you described.

Here are the major changes in this update:

🕸️ The Node Map (Network Board): Replaced the linear track with a connected graph of spiritual locations (Congregation, Family, Ministry, etc.). Players move their avatars between nodes.

📏 Proximity Logic: Added a pathfinding system that calculates distance between players. You can now only "Encourage" (give cards) if you are within 2 nodes of a friend.

🎲 Faith in Action (Trivia): When playing specific cards, a "Trivia Modal" appears. You roll a digital die to determine difficulty, and answering correctly boosts the card's power.

⚔️ Adversary & Supply Decks: Separated the decks. The round starts by revealing a Challenge (requires points to beat) and a Circumstance (global effect).

🔥 Armageddon Mode: A game state that shifts objectives from "solving challenges" to pure "survival" against waves of attacks.

the node map can be improve. there doesn't have to be names on node except for specific ones. now that I think about it let's do this.



there should be definitely more nodes. like 50-100. Then add like an area (where multiple players can go). these are special nodes (if players pass through this node, supply points is added. add a kingdom hall area node, and territories area nodes (can be 4 or 5). if a player passes through this area node, going back is not allowed. if a players passes through 3 of this, 5 points is added.



at the beginning each player starts on the player node (the node in fron t of them. maybe there can be 10 player nodes (doesn't have to be 10 players all the time, leave blank if less players).

I have significantly expanded the Node Map and Movement Mechanics to align with your vision.

Key Upgrades in this Version:
Procedural Map Generation: The game now generates 60+ nodes arranged in concentric "Zones".

Zone 0 (Outer Ring): 10 Dedicated Player Start Nodes.

Zone 1 (Field): Standard nodes for movement.

Zone 2 (Territories): 5 Special Territory Nodes. Passing through these gives Supply Points.

Zone 3 (Inner Field): Nodes getting closer to the center.

Zone 4 (Center): The Kingdom Hall.

One-Way Progression Logic: I implemented your "cannot go back" rule using a Zone System.

Players can move sideways (same zone) or forward (inward toward Kingdom Hall).

Players cannot move backward to a lower zone (e.g., you cannot go from Territory back to the outer rim).

Special Scoring Logic:

Territory/Kingdom Hall Bonus: Entering these nodes adds +2 Points to the current Challenge automatically.

The "Circuit" Bonus: If a player visits 3 distinct Special Nodes, the group gets an instant +5 Point Bonus.

Here is the updated code:

please show the draw pile and active challenge and circumstances

I have updated the prototype to explicitly visualize the Supply Deck (Draw Pile) on the board and grouped the Active Challenge and Circumstance cards together at the top of the screen so all active game-state cards are clearly visible.

please add to the code a complete prototype cards and add random logic to the order of cards and piles.

I have significantly expanded the card database to include a full prototype set of 30+ unique Supply cards and 15+ Adversary events, and implemented a robust shuffling algorithm that properly structures the game narrative (random challenges first -> Great Tribulation mid-game -> Armageddon finale).

Here are the changes:

Expanded Card Library: Added specific Bible trivia (Faith Actions), varied spiritual qualities, and diverse trials.

Smart Deck Construction:

Supply Deck: Fully randomized.

Adversary Deck: Logic now places "Great Tribulation" in the bottom half of the deck and ensures "Armageddon" is always the final boss.

Gameplay Variety: Every session will now feature a different sequence of challenges and circumstances.

how many cards does each player start with? and why can't the players draw from the supply deck

Based on the current code in game_prototype.jsx:

Starting Hand: Each player starts with 3 cards.

This is defined in the startGame function: p.hand = supplyDeck.splice(0, 3);.

Drawing Logic: You cannot manually draw from the supply deck because there is no onClick function attached to the visible deck pile, and the logic is currently set to draw automatically only when you end your turn.

In the endTurn function, the code explicitly takes the top card and adds it to the player's hand: if (card) updatedPlayers[turnIndex].hand.push(card);.

If you would like to change this (e.g., allow players to spend 1 Action Point to draw an extra card during their turn), I can easily add an onClick handler to the Supply Deck to enable that feature.

let's add the allow players to spend 1 Action Point to draw an extra card during their turn. also, the node arrangement and links are somehow too symmetric. there should be some randomness to it. and there should be more normal nodes. it would be too easy if a player can immediately go to the territory on first turn.



also, please show all cards of the players, just rotate the board on the active players each turn.

Hello! I can certainly implement those features. This update transforms the prototype into a true "Tabletop Mode" experience.

Here are the key upgrades:

🔀 Organic Map Generation: The node map now uses noise and randomness. It's no longer a perfect circle; paths are jagged, and node density varies, making the journey to Territories harder and less predictable.

🃏 Action: Buy a Card: I've enabled the Supply Deck. You can now tap it to spend 1 AP and draw a card.

🔄 Tabletop Rotation: The entire interface now rotates automatically based on whose turn it is.

Players sit around the device (Bottom, Left, Top, Right).

When the turn passes, the board spins so the Active Player is always at the "bottom" reading position.

All player hands are visible simultaneously (since it's cooperative).

why does it look like the nodes are disconnected?



Also, add the player's active cards (advantage/trial/etc) to the left side of the card on hands. add visual of the 2 pile cards on the upper left then 2 active challenge/circumstance cards just below them.



highligh the wildcards on hand just for visibility.



also, I don't see the first clickable node for the active player.

I have updated the code to address your visual feedback and feature requests.

Key Improvements:
🔗 Fixed Connections: I tweaked the map generation to guarantee that Start Nodes always connect to the Outer Ring. I also increased the visibility of the connection lines.

🃏 Active Card Zone: Added a "Tableau" area to the left of each player's hand. When you play Quality or Trial cards, they now stay on the table in this zone instead of disappearing.

📚 Decks & Threats Display: Moved the Adversary Deck and Supply Deck to the upper-left of the board. The Active Challenge and Circumstance cards now appear visually just below them, creating a clear "Threat Area."

✨ Wildcard Highlights: Prayer cards (Wildcards) now have a distinct Golden Glow in the hand.

📍 First Move Fix: I increased the connection range for Start Nodes so the first move is always available.

don't edit the code, just answer. why do players have a trial card on the starter hand? Aren't trial cards supposed to be drawn and immediately take ffect on the active card display?

You are absolutely correct based on the design we discussed, but here is why the current code behaves this way:

Deck Construction: In the code, the SUPPLY_POOL array contains the Trial cards (Doubt, Anxiety, Fatigue). The supplyDeck is built by shuffling this pool.

Dealing Logic: The startGame function simply takes the top 3 cards of that shuffled deck and pushes them into the player's hand array (p.hand = supplyDeck.splice(0, 3)). It does not currently check the type of card being dealt.

Missing "Interrupt" Logic: The code functions for drawing cards (startGame, handleDrawCard, and endTurn) currently treat all cards the same: they add them to your hand.

To match your design intention: The code logic needs a specific condition during the Draw phase: If the drawn card is type 'Trial', do not add to Hand; instead, immediately add to player.activeCards (the tableau). Currently, the prototype treats them like "playable" cards that cost AP to activate (which represents "succumbing" to the trial), rather than forced instant events.

player's 2 and 4 are upside down. when rotating. please make the cards bigger as well.

I have updated the code to correct the orientation of Players 2 and 4 so they are no longer upside down during rotation. I also increased the card size significantly for better readability and visibility.

Changes Made:
Fixed Rotation Logic: Players 2 (Left) and 4 (Right) now have their rotation set to rotate-90 and -rotate-90 respectively. This ensures that when the table rotates to make them the "Active Player" at the bottom, they land in an upright position.

Bigger Cards: Introduced a new md size for cards in the hand (w-20 h-32), making them much easier to tap and read.

Expanded Containers: Adjusted the PlayerHand container dimensions to accommodate the larger cards without clipping.

make the draw pile bigger as well, but put them on the side of the node map, not over

Hello! I will make those adjustments for you. I'm moving the decks outside the circular play area into the corners of the table surface so they don't obstruct the nodes, and I'm increasing their size for better visibility.

Here are the specific updates:

Moved Draw Piles: The Supply and Adversary decks are now positioned in the Top-Left corner of the rotating table surface, sitting outside the circular node map.

Increased Deck Size: Introduced a new lg card size (w-24 h-40) specifically for these draw piles.

Cleaned Node Map: The node map is now purely for navigation, with no UI overlay cluttering it.

I made some changes. I fixed the ReferenceError: onDrawCard is not defined by updating the onClick handler in the TacticalGame component to correctly reference handleDrawCard. I also added safety checks to the Card component to prevent the "Objects are not valid as a React child" error by ensuring data.icon is valid before cloning.

why is the start node of player one not in front of him. also make the node map smaller so that no card overlaps on it. full visibility.

I have adjusted the map generation to perfectly align the Start Nodes with the players' seating positions (Player 1 at the bottom, Player 2 at the left, etc.). I also shrunk the entire node map significantly (both by increasing the board's padding and reducing the internal spacing) to ensure no cards overlap with the gameplay area.

there's still duplicate draw pile on the node map. also the node map are not spread evenly.

I have updated the code to refine the map layout and fix the UI issues.

Key Fixes:
Static Deck & HUD: I moved the Adversary and Supply decks outside the rotating table container. They are now fixed to the top-left of the screen, ensuring they never overlap the board or rotate awkwardly.

Even Node Distribution: I rewrote the generateMap function to use concentric rings with evenly spaced angles (plus a tiny random offset for organic feel). This ensures no clumping.

Guaranteed Connectivity: The connection logic now enforces that every node connects to at least one node in the ring below it (inward), preventing "islands" or unreachable nodes.

Removed Duplicates: By pulling the decks out of the map component entirely, any risk of duplication is resolved.

move the end turn button to the low right area so that it doesn't hover over the active player's cards on hand.

I have moved the "End Turn" button to the bottom-right corner of the screen so it no longer obstructs the active player's hand.

I don't see the required points (also change it from supply to faith points). add it to the upper right hand corner. Change the Adverstary to Trial Cards, and add another draw pile called "circumstance" deck". the goal why there's 2 challenge deck is to have vast unique combinations of challenge rounds.

I have updated the prototype with your requested changes.

Key Features Added:
3 Distinct Decks:

Trial Deck (Red): Contains Challenges and Events (Armageddon, Great Tribulation).

Circumstance Deck (Slate): Contains environmental modifiers (Heavy Rains, Heatwave).

Supply Deck (Indigo): The player cards.

Faith Points Tracker (Top Right): A dedicated HUD element in the top-right corner clearly shows the Current/Required Faith Points for the active challenge.

Dual Draw Logic: Each round now pulls one card from the Trial deck and one from the Circumstance deck to create unique combinations.

please give me the complete game manual with complete instructions for each card type and special cards.

I have compiled the complete official rulebook for Covenant & Kingdom. This manual covers every mechanic we have built, from the movement rules on the node map to the specific instructions for every card type.

I will generate a single-file HTML infographic that visualizes the gameplay mechanics, deck composition, and strategies of Covenant & Kingdom.

Plan:

Narrative Structure: I will structure the SPA into logical sections: "The Objective," "The Arsenal (Decks)," "The Journey (Board)," "Action Economy," and "The Cycle of Faith."

Visualizations (Canvas Only):

Deck Composition: A Chart.js Doughnut Chart to show the breakdown of the Supply Deck (Faith Actions, Prayers, Qualities, Trials).

Action Point Economy: A Chart.js Horizontal Bar Chart comparing the cost of different player actions.

Risk vs. Reward: A Chart.js Stacked Bar Chart illustrating the point potential of Faith Actions (Base vs. Trivia Bonus).

Board Zone Hierarchy: A Chart.js Polar Area Chart representing the concentric zones of the board (Start to Kingdom Hall).

Game Loop: A CSS-based flow diagram (using Flexbox/Grid and Unicode arrows, no SVG) to show the Round Phases.

Styling: I will use a vibrant palette (Indigo, Rose, Amber, Emerald) consistent with the "Brilliant Blues/Energetic" theme requested, implemented via Tailwind CSS.

Technical Compliance: All charts will be rendered on <canvas> elements. The specified label wrapping logic and tooltip configuration will be strictly implemented. No SVG or Mermaid JS will be used.

please integrate the game manual to the game code but on a different toggle tabs.

I have integrated a complete Game Manual into the app.

Updates:
Toggle Tabs: Added a persistent navigation bar at the very top of the screen (z-[100]) allowing you to switch between "Tabletop" (the game) and "Manual" (the rules).

Game Manual View: Created a rich, scrollable guide styled with the game's dark aesthetic. It covers:

The Mission: Win/Loss conditions.

The Cycle: Breakdown of the 3 phases (Threat, Action, Resolution).

The Arsenal: Explanations for Faith Actions, Prayers, Qualities, and Trials.

Map Legend: Key for understanding the node types.

State Persistence: The game continues to run in the background (state is preserved) while you read the manual, so you don't lose progress if you need to check a rule mid-game.

Put the P1-P4 indicator on the lower left corner. also put the Action pooints next to it. also the trial cards. to the corner.



the hand cards should be hidden by default only showing the top most area, on hover or on tap show the cards in full. on tap outside, auto-hide.



same with the other player's cards. they should only show the top-most area respectively (hidden on the sides or on the top-side).



this should give more space for the node map. please increase the size of the node map. then clean it up. players should not be able to go to the other player starter nodes directly. they should navigate through the normal nodes and find path that will make them closest to each other.

I have updated the prototype to maximize the map area and implement the "Peek & Reveal" mechanics for player hands.

Key Updates:
Map Expansion & Logic:

Bigger Board: The map now occupies 85% of the screen viewport (85vmin), significantly increasing the play area.

Restricted Paths: Players can no longer move directly between Start Nodes. You must navigate inward to the "Outer Field" (Zone 1) to begin meeting others.

Collapsible Hands (Stealth Mode):

Hidden by Default: All player hands are now tucked away at the edges of the screen. Only the Name Tag is visible.

Tap to Reveal: Tapping a player's name tag slides their hand out.

Auto-Hide: Tapping anywhere else on the board or waiting (logic simplified to toggle on click) hides the hand again.

New Bottom-Left HUD:

Player Indicator: Shows the Active Player (P1-P4).

Action Points: Displayed clearly next to the name.

Active Burden/Buff Zone: The active player's Quality and Trial cards (Tableau) are now displayed in this corner, separate from the hand, decluttering the view.

it seems that the hand cards totally disappeared. I can't tap or hover to reveal. also the rule page content was removed.

Hello! I've fixed the issues. I restored the full Game Manual content and adjusted the Player Hand mechanics so the name tabs are always visible and clickable (using a precise calculation to ensure they don't slide off-screen).

Fixes Implemented:
Hand Visibility: Changed the hiding logic from a percentage (85%) to a calculated value (calc(100% - 3rem)). This ensures the Name Tab always sticks out 3rem from the edge, making it easy to tap/hover to reveal the cards.

Full Manual Restored: The ManualView component now contains the complete rulebook text, legend, and card explanations again.

Z-Index Safety: Ensured the hands render on top of the map layer so interactions aren't blocked.

Here is the corrected, complete file:

the reveal button is barely clickable, please increase the side. the side reveal button is nowhere to be found. make it relative to the canvas size so that it's always there to be clicked.

I have updated the prototype with larger, more reliable interaction zones and a cleaned-up, expanded map.

Key Improvements:
Interactable Player Tabs:

The "Reveal Hand" buttons are now significantly larger (h-12) and use a fixed height calculation so they always protrude from the screen edge, regardless of screen size.

I adjusted the rotation origins to ensure the side players (Left/Right) are perfectly centered and accessible.

Expanded Node Map:

Increased map size to 90% of the viewport, giving maximum space for navigation.

Strict Pathing: I removed lateral connections for Start Nodes. You must move inward to Zone 1 to begin connecting with others, reinforcing the "Gather Together" theme.

Consolidated HUD:

Bottom Left: Now houses the Active Player Indicator, Action Points, and the Tableau (Active Trials/Qualities) in a single, unified dashboard.

Top Left: Dedicated to Decks (Trial, Circumstance, Supply) and the Active Threat cards.

the P2 is expanded by default. make it hidden. increase the text size of the node map. make all face-up card clickable/tappable, on-do the card should center and expand and increase text size so that I can read it better and more clearly.

I have addressed all your requests in this updated game_prototype.jsx.

Key Changes:
🔍 Inspection Mode: Tapping any card (in hand, deck, or board) now opens a large Inspection Overlay.

The card is centered, scaled up, and text is significantly larger for readability.

"Play Card" Action: You now play cards from this inspection view (if it's your turn), preventing accidental misclicks.

🔧 Fixed Left Player (P2): Corrected the rotation logic for the player on the left. The hand now properly collapses off-screen instead of sticking into the play area.

🗺️ Map Readability: Increased the node label text size and slightly adjusted the map bounds for better visibility.

👆 Interaction: All UI elements (Reveal Tabs, Nodes, Cards) have larger touch targets.

why aren't there character cards?

I apologize for that oversight! In the transition to the tactical map mechanics, the Character Cards (which give unique player identities and abilities) were temporarily abstracted into generic players.

I have updated the code to restore them. Now, instead of playing as "P1" or "P2," you will play as specific Bible characters (Moses, Ruth, David, Esther), each with a unique Passive Ability displayed in your HUD.

Key Changes:
Character Assignment: Players are now assigned a specific Bible character at the start of the game.

Unique Abilities:

Moses: Lead the Way (First move each turn is free).

Ruth: Loyal Love (Helping range increased).

David: Fearless (Immune to the first "Fear" trial).

Esther: Royal Favor (Start with 1 extra card).

HUD Update: The bottom-left dashboard now displays your Character's Name and Ability description.

add more characters and make it random, also character cards can be drawn from the pile, and players can either change their active character. (suggest something that will give players reason to change their characters)



also, during great tribulations, players can put 2 characters and have effects from both. on final round, players can activate all characters (not sure if this mechanics make sense)

I have implemented your requests to deepen the character mechanics.

Key Features Added:
Expanded Roster: The game now features 12 Unique Bible Characters (Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Moses, Rahab, Gideon, etc.), each with distinct passive abilities.

Character Cards in Deck: You can now draw Character Cards from the Supply Deck.

Swapping & Activation Logic:

Normal Play: You can play a Character card to Swap your active character.

Strategic Reason: Swapping a character triggers "Fresh Zeal", instantly restoring your Action Points to 3. This allows for huge combo turns.

Great Tribulation: During this phase, your character slot limit increases to 2. You can have two active abilities simultaneously.

Armageddon: Your character slot limit becomes Unlimited. You can rally as many faithful servants as you have in your hand to stack massive bonuses for the final fight.

Updated HUD: The bottom-left display now dynamically lists all Active Characters and their abilities.

the character cards on hand doesn't seem to show the name of the character in the UI

I've updated the Card component logic. The issue was that the code prioritized the title property (e.g., "The Meekest") over the name property (e.g., "Moses"). Since Character cards have both, it was displaying the title instead of the name.

I have swapped the priority so it checks for data.name first, ensuring character names appear correctly on the cards in hand.

Hello! It looks like there was a syntax error in the previous code, likely a missing closing brace or parenthesis before the main game function, which caused the "Unexpected export" error.

I will fix this immediately by regenerating the complete, clean code for game_prototype.jsx. I'm also ensuring the Manual is fully readable and the Player 2/4 rotations are perfect.

I made some changes. I corrected the logic in the endTurn function to ensure that when the Esther character ability triggers a bonus draw, the card is properly removed from the deck state. This prevents the same card from being drawn twice by the same player, which was causing the "duplicate key" error.

the active character should show the effects it has on the player.

I have updated the "Active Characters" display in the bottom-left HUD to include the effect description (char.desc) alongside the character name and ability title. Now you can clearly see what bonus each character provides.

please explain the possible dilemmas the players faced when using their card.

Based on the game mechanics and card types defined in the prototype, here is an analysis of the strategic dilemmas players face when deciding how and when to use their cards.

These dilemmas are the core engine of tension in Covenant & Kingdom.

1. The Trivia Gamble (Faith Action Cards)
This is the most frequent decision point. Faith Action cards offer Base Points (guaranteed) and Bonus Points (conditional on answering a trivia question).

The Dilemma: Certainty vs. Necessity.

Scenario: The group needs 5 points to pass the current "Economic Crisis" challenge. You have a "Bold Witness" card (2 Base + 5 Bonus).

The Choice:

Play it Safe: Do you have other cards to make up the difference? If you play it without rolling, you get 2 points. It's safe, but inefficient.

Take the Risk: If you roll for the Bonus, you could get 7 points total. But if you roll a "Hard" question and get it wrong, you might fail the challenge entirely if the group was relying on that bonus.

Pressure: The "Digital Surveillance" Circumstance card might be active, disabling bonuses entirely, forcing players to burn more cards for the same effect.

2. The Hoarding Paradox (Prayer Cards)
Prayer cards are "Wildcards" or powerful instants (e.g., "Restore 1 Unity" or "Add 3 Points").

The Dilemma: Immediate Relief vs. Final Survival.

Scenario: The group is at 3/5 Unity. A "Congregation Dispute" trial threatens to drop Unity by -2.

The Choice:

Burn the Prayer: Use "Prayer of Thanks" now to restore Unity or "Prayer for Wisdom" to auto-solve the dispute. The round is saved.

Hold for Armageddon: The final boss ("Armageddon") requires a massive 40 points. Prayer cards are essential for generating that much raw power quickly. If you burn them on early-game disputes, you may find yourself defenseless in the endgame.

3. The Engine vs. The Fire (Quality Cards)
Quality cards (e.g., "Loyal Love", "Joy") are permanent buffs that sit on the table ("Tableau").

The Dilemma: Investment vs. Crisis Management.

Scenario: It costs 1 Action Point (AP) to play a Quality. The current Trial requires 15 points.

The Choice:

Build the Engine: Play "Joy" now. It gives you nothing immediately, but grants +1 AP every future turn. This pays off huge in the long run.

Fight the Fire: Use that 1 AP to play a Faith Action instead to contribute points to the current Trial. If you spend the AP on the buff, the group might fail the current Trial because you didn't contribute points.

4. The Burden of Brotherhood (Personal Trial Cards)
These cards (e.g., "Anxiety", "Doubt") are debuffs that attach to a player. The player cannot remove them alone; another player must be nearby to "Help."

The Dilemma: Mission Speed vs. Compassion.

Scenario: Player 1 has "Fatigue" (Max 2 AP). Player 2 is 3 nodes away.

The Choice:

Stop and Help: Player 2 spends their entire turn moving closer and using the "Help" action to remove the card. The group generates 0 points this turn, risking the Round Goal.

Leave Them Behind: The group ignores Player 1's struggle to focus on the main objective. Player 1 becomes dead weight, generating less AP and unable to contribute effectively, potentially spiraling the team into a loss later.

5. The "Fresh Zeal" Swap (Character Cards)
Players can draw Character cards (e.g., Moses, Esther) from the deck. Playing one swaps your active character and instantly restores your AP to 3.

The Dilemma: Identity vs. Action Economy.

Scenario: You are playing as David (+1 Bonus to all actions). You have used all your AP. You draw Gideon (Reroll dice).

The Choice:

Keep the Passive: David's +1 bonus is mathematically strong for the team. You keep him but end your turn.

Trigger the Reset: You play Gideon. You lose David's bonus, but you instantly get 3 fresh AP to play 3 more cards right now. This is a massive "Nova" turn, but you lose your preferred passive ability for the rest of the game.

6. Positioning vs. Contribution (The Map)
Moving costs 1 AP. Playing cards costs 1 AP.

The Dilemma: Safety vs. output.

Scenario: You are in the Outer Zone (Start). You need to get to Zone 2 (Territory) to get free points.

The Choice:

Move: Spend all 3 AP to rush to the Territory. You are safer and get passive points, but you contribute zero cards to the current Trial this turn.

Contribute: Stay in the danger zone to play cards and help the group pass the trial, but risk getting hit by range-limited events or failing to meet up with other players for help.

looks good. let's add a few trial cards that when drawn it requires the player to discard something like a card on hand, or to move 1 node away from the nearest player or nearest territory/kingdom hall, and other negative actions like maybe minus points. for each card add some graphics that gives an example of a trial or negative trait like "unwise use of time" or "showy display" or "bad associations" or "binge drinking", etc.





also, change the naming for the Supply deck. name it something more related than just "supply". please suggest.



also the challenge goal, rename it to "faith required" or something. I want this to be spiritually/biblically themed.

I have added the new Trial Cards with the specific themes you requested (Unwise Use of Time, Showy Display, Overdrinking, Bad Associations), renamed the deck to "Provisions", and changed the goal text to "Faith Required".

Updates:
New Thematic Trial Cards:

Unwise Use of Time: Reduces AP (Time is lost).

Showy Display: Blocks Territory bonuses (Focus on self, not the kingdom).

Bad Associations: Prevents helping others (Isolation).

Overdrinking: Reduces AP (Sluggishness).

Renaming:

Supply Deck → Provisions Deck.

Challenge Goal → Faith Required.

New Icons: Integrated Clock, Gem, Wine, Frown for the new cards.

abraham players grant +1 extra point - what does this mean exactly?

In the context of the game mechanics, Abraham's ability means that whenever a player with Abraham as their active character plays a Prayer card to contribute to a Challenge, it counts for more.

Specifically:

Most Prayer Cards (like Prayer for Wisdom) have a base value (e.g., 3 Faith Points).

If Abraham plays it, his passive ability ("Friend of God") adds +1, making that card worth 4 Faith Points toward the goal.

I noticed that while David's bonus logic was in the code, Abraham's logic was missing. I have updated the code to implement this mechanic properly.

Change Log:

Updated handlePlayCard to check if the active character is Abraham when playing a Prayer card.

If true, it passes a bonus of 1 to the scoring function.

add a rule that starter cards will not include trial cards.

I have updated the startGame logic to ensure that Trial cards are excluded from the initial hand dealing. Players will now start with a "clean" hand of 3 safe cards, and the Trials will be shuffled back into the remaining deck for the gameplay phase.

what does territory bosunes are doubled (+4) exactly mean? This is for Rahab.



Please make all description explicit.

In the game Covenant & Kingdom, Rahab's ability modifies the reward for exploring the map.

Normally, when any player moves onto a Territory Node (the blue nodes in Zone 2) for the first time, the group gains +2 Faith Points toward the current Challenge goal.

Rahab's Ability (+4) means:

If the active player is using Rahab, landing on that same node generates +4 Faith Points instead of +2.

This makes her a powerful "scout" character, excellent for quickly generating points in the early game without spending cards.

I have updated the code below to make all character descriptions explicit and implemented the logic so Rahab actually grants the bonus points in the game.

Code Updates
Explicit Text: Rewrote all character and card descriptions to be precise about mechanics (e.g., "0 Action Points" instead of "Free").

Rahab Mechanic: Updated handleMove to check for Rahab and award 4 points instead of 2.

Moses Mechanic: Implemented logic to actually track if the player has moved yet, making his first move cost 0 AP.

starter hand should not include extra characters.

I have updated the startGame logic to ensure that neither Trial cards nor Character cards appear in the initial hand. Players will now start only with Faith Actions, Prayers, or Qualities, while Characters and Trials are shuffled into the deck for later draws.

does each character swap action refresh action points? is the character card then thrown into the used card pile?

Yes, exactly! Here is how the Character Swap mechanic works based on the current code:

Fresh Zeal (AP Refresh): Whenever you play a Character Card to swap (or add) a character, your Action Points are instantly reset to 3. This allows for powerful "combo turns" where you spend your initial AP, swap characters, and then get a fresh set of AP to keep going.

Card Fate: The Character Card you just played does not go to the discard pile immediately. Instead, it moves from your Hand to your Active Character Slot on the table.

If you already had a character (and no empty slots), the old character is removed (effectively discarded) and replaced by the new one.

The new card stays in front of you, providing its passive ability until it is swapped out again.

how many characters can a player have ?

Based on the current game logic in the code, here is the character limit ruleset:

Standard Gameplay: 1 Character

You start with 1 active character.

If you play a new Character card from your hand, it replaces your current character (triggering the "Fresh Zeal" AP reset).

During "Great Tribulation": 2 Characters

When this specific Event card is active, the limit increases. You can have two active characters simultaneously, benefiting from both of their passive abilities.

During "Armageddon": Unlimited

In the final round, the limit is removed (set to 99 in the code). You can activate every Character card you have in your hand to stack as many bonuses as possible for the final stand.

so the players have the dilemma whether to play a character card on normal round or keep it until the great tribulation and armageddon round. that's brilliant.

Exactly! It turns Character cards into a high-stakes strategic resource.

You have to weigh the immediate benefit of a "Fresh Zeal" AP reset (which could save you from failing a tough Trial right now) against the massive long-term value of stacking abilities during the Great Tribulation and Armageddon.

It perfectly mirrors the theme: do you use your strength to help now, or save your "gathering together" for the final test? It rewards players who plan ahead while keeping the tension high in every round.

are all rounds supposed to be overcome before the GT and armageddon? or is there a mechanic that jumps the game to the GT/Armageddon?

Based on the current code, here is how the progression works:

Survival, Not Perfection: You do not need to successfully "overcome" every round to reach the end. The game acts as a timeline. Whether you pass or fail a Challenge, the game moves to the next card in the deck. Failing just drains your Unity (health). Your goal is simply to survive (keep Unity above 0) until the deck runs out.

Linear Progression: Currently, there is no mechanic that skips cards. You must play through the roughly 10-12 cards in the Trial deck to reach the Great Tribulation (inserted in the middle) and Armageddon (always the last card).

Recommendation: "Days Cut Short" Mechanic
If you want to add a mechanic that "jumps" the game forward (based on Matthew 24:22 "unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved"), I can implement this rule:

Trigger: If Unity drops to 1, the game immediately searches the deck for the Great Tribulation or Armageddon card and moves it to the top.

Thematic Reason: The group is on the brink of spiritual collapse, so the final events are accelerated to bring the issue to a head immediately.

Would you like me to add this "Days Cut Short" mechanic to the code?

let's discuss the GT and armageddon gameplay. explain an example scenario that might occur on this round.

Here is an example scenario illustrating how the mechanics shift during the Great Tribulation (GT) and culminate in Armageddon.

These phases are designed to break the standard "1-turn-at-a-time" rhythm, forcing players to unleash everything they’ve been hoarding.

Phase 1: The Great Tribulation (The Shift)
Context: The players are deep in the game. The deck is running low. The group is weary (Unity is at 2/5). Suddenly, the Great Tribulation event card is drawn from the Trial Deck.

The Mechanical Shift:

Old Rule: Max 1 Character per player.

New Rule: Max 2 Characters per player.

The Threat: A "Persecution" Trial (Req: 20 Faith) is active alongside the GT event.

The Scenario:

Player 1 (Active: Moses): Currently benefits from Lead the Way (Free Move). They are stuck in Zone 1 (Outer Field).

The Dilemma: They need to generate points for the Persecution trial, but they also need to get to the Kingdom Hall (Center) for the endgame.

The Turn:

Move (0 AP): Moses allows a free move inward.

Play Character (1 AP): P1 has Peter in their hand. They play him.

Normally: Peter would replace Moses.

GT Effect: Peter joins Moses. P1 now has Moses + Peter active.

Fresh Zeal: Action Points reset to 3.

Move (1 AP): Using Peter's Zeal ability (Move 2 nodes for 1 AP), P1 surges forward into Zone 3.

Play Faith Action (1 AP): P1 plays "Bold Witness". They roll the die... Success!

End Turn: P1 draws 2 cards (thanks to an active Esther buff on Player 2 helping the group).

Result: The GT phase allows players to start stacking abilities to handle tougher map requirements and harder trials.

Phase 2: Armageddon (The Final Stand)
Context: The final card of the deck is revealed. Trial: ARMAGEDDON Requirement: 40 Faith Points (Double a normal trial). Circumstance: "Digital Surveillance" (No Trivia Bonuses allowed—you only get Base Points).

The Mechanical Shift:

New Rule: Unlimited Characters. You can activate every faithful servant in your hand.

The Goal: You need raw output. 40 points is impossible with standard turns (3 AP). You need to chain "Fresh Zeal" resets.

The Scenario (The "Nova" Turn):

Player 3 (Active: Ruth): It is their turn. The team has contributed 12/40 points so far. Player 3 has a hand full of Character cards they've been saving.

Action 1 (1 AP): Plays Gideon.

Effect: Gideon joins Ruth. AP resets to 3.

Action 2 (1 AP): Plays Daniel.

Effect: Daniel joins Ruth & Gideon. AP resets to 3.

Action 3 (1 AP): Plays Sarah.

Effect: Sarah joins the group. AP resets to 3.

Current State: Player 3 now has 4 Active Characters and 3 AP.

The Combo:

Player 3 plays a Prayer for Wisdom (Base 3 Points).

Abraham Bonus: Player 4 has Abraham active, boosting Prayer cards by +1. (Total: 4 Pts).

David Bonus: Player 2 has David active, boosting all actions by +1. (Total: 5 Pts).

Player 3 plays 3 Prayers in a row using their refreshed AP.

Total Output: 15 Points in a single turn.

Result: The group reaches 40/40. The Unity marker holds. The trial is overcome.

Why this works:
Hoarding Tension: In the early game, you want to play Character cards to get "Fresh Zeal" (AP resets) to survive minor trials. But if you spend them all early, you won't have enough "fuel" to chain resets during Armageddon.

Thematic Resonance: During Armageddon, the "Little Flock" and "Other Sheep" are uniting. Seeing a player's HUD fill up with Moses, Elijah, Peter, and Esther all working together creates a powerful visual of the "Cloud of Witnesses" supporting the player.

let's add a mechanic that when GT strikes, the territory becomes inner rooms that can fit 2-3 players (depending on how many players). and some normal nodes disappear shat paths are limited.

You stopped this response
let's add a mechanic that when GT strikes, the territory becomes inner rooms that can fit 2-3 players (depending on how many players). and some normal nodes disappear shat paths are limited.

I have implemented the Great Tribulation (GT) Map Transformation mechanics.

Key Changes:
Dynamic Map State: The map is no longer static. It is now stored in the game state (mapData), allowing it to change mid-game.

Great Tribulation Event:

Territories Transform: All "Territory" nodes become "Inner Rooms" (safe houses).

The Shake-Up: Approximately 40% of "Normal" nodes collapse and disappear, breaking established paths and forcing players to find new routes.

Capacity Limits: "Inner Rooms" have a strict capacity limit (2 players for <4 total, 3 players for 4+). You cannot enter if it's full.

Visuals:

Inner Rooms: Depicted with a DoorOpen icon and a distinct purple/indigo glow.

Map Updates: When GT strikes, you will see the map physically change layout.

I made some changes. I defined currentPlayer explicitly with a safe fallback object to prevent the ReferenceError when the game state initializes. I also added a check to ensure players is populated before accessing it, and verified that all text rendering inside components (like PlayerHand and Card) properly accesses string properties (.name, .title) rather than trying to render objects directly.

I made some changes. I defined the generateConnections function to be reusable and refactored generateMap to use it. I also updated startGame to call generateMap instead of the undefined generateInitialMap and verified that triggerGreatTribulation has access to generateConnections.

it seems the game is broken. there's no trial and circumstance.

I have fixed the game loop logic to ensure Trial and Circumstance cards appear correctly and the game proceeds reliably from round to round.

Key Fixes:
Game Loop Logic: Rewrote the endRound and useEffect hooks. Now, endRound correctly pauses for 2 seconds (to show Victory/Defeat) before clearing the board and setting the phase to START. The useEffect then detects this "clean slate" and automatically deals the next round.

State Dependencies: Added missing dependencies (trialDeck, currentChallenge, roundPhase) to the main game loop, ensuring it fires reliably when the game starts or a round ends.

UI Feedback: Added a "Phase Indicator" in the top center so you can see if the game is in Action or Resolving mode.

why do players in the kingdom hall node can no longer leave?



also which cards can be played to remove the personal trial cards and who can play them?

Based on the current code in game_prototype.jsx:

Why players cannot leave the Kingdom Hall: The movement logic (validMoves) enforces a "One-Way Flow" rule:

JavaScript
return targetNode.zone >= current.zone;
The Kingdom Hall is Zone 4. The nodes connected to it are in the Inner Ring (Zone 3). Since 3 is not greater than or equal to 4, the game logic considers those moves invalid. This is intentional to represent the journey from the "Outer World" into safety, but it means once you are in, you cannot go back out.

Which cards remove Personal Trials: Currently, there is no specific card or action implemented in the code to remove Personal Trials once they are in the "Active" area.

While the Manual mentions a "Resolve Personal Trial" action or using "Help," the actual interactive buttons for these actions have not been coded into the prototype yet.

In the card database (SUPPLY_POOL), there are currently no cards with a specific "Remove Burden" or "Remove Trial" effect.

Would you like me to update the code to:

Add a "Rest/Return" mechanic to allow movement out of the Kingdom Hall?

Implement the "Help" action so players near each other can spend AP to remove those Trial cards?

let's add cards that will remove personal trial cards. 2 kinds, one for own trial, other can only be used to help other players remove theirs (node distance rule applies)



also I want constant movement on the board to keep it interactive rather than just players chilling in the kingdom hall the whole game. there has to be a mechanic that keeps players moving. Maybe a daily normal activities cards that requires the players to be transported to nodes that has negative effects or just barely stuck there. on this note, let's expand the map nodes further 1 layer out. then scatter some random special nodes like "supermarket" or "work" or "school", these are normal nodes that players teleport to when specific cards are drawn. please integrate this mechanic smoothly with other cards. these nodes can either require faith points or something so that players can move out of it.



is this too complicated already or just good?

I think those additions are excellent, not too complicated. They solve the "camping" problem (a common issue in cooperative games) and reinforce the theme that "life happens" and distracts from spiritual goals.

Here is the plan for the update:

New Cards:

"Reflection" (Self): Removes a Personal Trial from your own tableau.

"Encouragement" (Others): Removes a Personal Trial from a friend (must be within range).

"Life Obligation" Cards: When drawn from the Supply deck, these auto-trigger, teleporting you to specific nodes (Work, School, Market) and ending your turn immediately.

Map Expansion:

Added 3 Special "Trap" Nodes in the outer zones: Work, School, and Market.

Trap Mechanic: Leaving these nodes costs 2 Action Points (simulating traffic/overtime), making it hard to get back to the Kingdom Hall quickly.

Updated Logic:

handlePlayCard now supports removing trials.

handleDrawCard and endTurn now detect "Obligation" cards and trigger teleportation.

Here is the updated code:

maybe add 2 more distraction nodes.

I have added 2 new distraction nodes ("Stadium" and "Resort") to the map and corresponding Obligation cards to the deck.

Updates:
Map Expansion: Added Stadium (Entertainment) and Resort (Vacation) nodes to the Outer Ring.

New Obligation Cards:

"Concert Tickets": Teleports player to the Stadium.

"Weekend Getaway": Teleports player to the Resort.

Visual Update: The map now displays specific icons for each distraction node (Briefcase, School Hat, Cart, Music Note, Plane).

change stadium to recreation (no negative effect) just require faith points (or deduct from faith required pool), for player to move out from.



change the resort to Vacation - negative effects is next territory node will require 2 AP or something.

I have updated the code to include the Recreation and Vacation mechanics as requested.

Key Changes:
New Node Mechanics:

Recreation (Zone 1): Replacing the Stadium. Moving out of this node is physically easy (1 AP) but spiritually costly—it deducts 2 Faith Points from the group's progress (simulating distraction/time lost).

Vacation (Zone 1): Replacing the Resort. Leaving this node applies a "sluggishness" effect: the next time you try to secure a Territory, it will cost 2 AP instead of 1.

Updated Obligations:

"Recreation Time" teleports you to the Recreation node.

"Vacation Trip" teleports you to the Vacation node.

Visuals: Updated labels and logic in the map generation to reflect these changes.

make special nodes clickable to reveal effects, both the positive and negative.

I have updated the code to make Special Nodes (Traps, Territories, Kingdom Hall) clickable.

Key Changes:
Node Inspection System:

Clicking a Standard Node (dots) still moves you immediately if valid.

Clicking a Special Node (Icons like Work, Kingdom Hall, Territory) now opens a Node Inspection Modal.

Node Inspection Modal:

Displays the Node Name and Icon.

Explicitly lists Positive Effects (e.g., "+2 Faith Points") and Negative Effects (e.g., "Cost 2 AP to leave").

Includes a "Travel Here" button if the node is within range and you have enough AP.

Expanded Node Data: Added detailed descriptions for all special node types to the inspection logic.

why vacation is not inspectable?

The Vacation node is located in the top-left quadrant of the map (at ~234 degrees), which places it directly underneath the Decks UI in the top-left corner. This overlap makes it impossible to click.

I have updated the code to shrink the map slightly (from 90vmin to 80vmin) to pull the outer nodes inward, ensuring they are clear of the corner UI elements. I also verified the inspection logic to ensure the Vacation modal triggers correctly.

does this whole code live in 1 file?

Yes, all of the code provided above—including the game logic, card databases, map generation, and UI components—lives in a single file named game_prototype.jsx.

This follows the single-file requirement for this environment to ensure the React application compiles and runs correctly as a self-contained unit.

is it possible to download this thread chat?

I don't have the ability to generate a downloadable file of our conversation thread directly.

However, you can:

Copy and paste the text into a document.

Check the menu options (often three dots ... or a "Share" icon) in this interface, as some platforms allow you to export or share the chat link.

If you want to save the Code, you can copy it directly from the editor panel.
